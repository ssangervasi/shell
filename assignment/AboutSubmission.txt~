A Shell
by: Nickie VanMeter and Sebastian Sangervasi

Notes:
	The Makefile currently will compile the file "mains.c", which was the file out of which we
worked throughout the project. Currently it is an identical copy of "part2.c", which is our
official submission for part 2.
	The file "part1.c" is our submission for part 1.

Workload:
	For most of the project we worked together, side by side, neck and neck... anyway...
	Exceptions would be:
		- we used Sebastian's "tokenify" program to parse commands, after some editing.
		- we used Sebastian's linked-list homework for our "struct node" uses. Note that
			there are some excess functions associated with this that should be ignored.

	Once we got through our basic setup of main(), part 1, we divided the programming so 
that Sebastian wrote the runSeq() function and Nickie wrote the parallel() function. Both
of these immediately crashed, so we collaboratively -- eh, hem -- perfected them. 

	Part 2 was almost entirely collaborative. We did make use of the polling code that 
Prof. Sommers posted to Piazza.
